            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The Path of Honorable Accord was formed by the chivalric tenets of the old Road of Kings, as well as
                various mortal codes of knighthood, with recent additions of Asian philosophies. They orientate
                themselves on the Code of Milan and the three Towers of Honor, Courage and Duty, which are detailed in
                six different allegorical tales to illustrate the aspect of the Path. It was developed by Master Frazier
                at the Black Monastery in 1666 CE.</p>
            <p>Cainites on the Path of Honorable Accord have always placed a high value on ritual and ceremony. The
                Sabbat's Knights therefore always participate in War Parties, ritae, ceremonies, and other pack events.
                As a whole, the followers of the Path seek to knit together the disparate factions of the sect under the
                common banner of loyalty to a cause. Although alternately ignored or derided by followers of other
                Paths, the Knights are a stern example of the best qualities of any Sabbat, and they cannot be faulted
                by their brethren. Knights do not often take leadership positions (as they find the political duplicity
                appalling), though they are at the forefront of many battles, showing courage and discipline unmatched
                by any other soldiers among the undead.</p>
            <p>Knights are by turns cold and aloof, yet honorable and trustworthy. A Knight never goes back on his word
                and always honors his agreements. He does not shirk on his duty or flee from battle. Still, he is far
                from humane: The Knight sees humans as a resource, just as another warrior might see a fine warhorse as
                admirable but far from an equitable associate. Many of this Path's followers display a grim and taciturn
                image, but the Knights are capable of humor and joviality – they simply find that duty outweighs
                personal gratification.</p>
            <p>The vast majority of this Path's followers are of Ventrue antitribu and Salubri antitribu blood, but a
                fair number of Nosferatu antitribu, traditionalist Tzimisce, and even reasonably lucid Malkavian
                antitribu study this Path. Panders who serve the ideals of the Sabbat (instead of crusading for personal
                advancement) espouse this Path as well. A rare few Camarilla elders, primarily Ventrue, hold on to the
                precepts of this Path from their nights of vampiric, medieval chivalry - their contribution vital in
                keeping the unity of the sect. In modern nights, many Alastors and Jovians end up following this path as
                their humanity dwindles during their journeys.</p>
            <p>A follower of the Path of Honorable Accord must always keep honor foremost in his mind. A Knight cannot
                act rashly or in haste; he must always be aware of the nature and consequences of his actions. The
                devout student of this Path must hold onto courage and discipline at all times while he seeks to
                dispense justice and fairness. The true Knight fights and dies, for his cause. Compassion, however, has
                no place in the heart of the knight. Errors leads to flaws, flaws lead to weakness and weakness leads to
                ruin.</p>

                    are a threat to the Sabbat."</p>
